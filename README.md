## My Portfolio
My portfolio project is about my portfolio. It has an about section that basically describes who I am, what I do, what I enjoy doing and my education background. It also states some of my relevant skills.
The Work Section is about the work I have done previously, the languages I used and what the work was all about. It also includes some of the languages I used.
