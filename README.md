## My Portfolio
My portfolio project is about my portfolio. It has an about section that basically describes who I am, what I do, what I enjoy doing and my education background. It also states some of my relevant skills.
The Work Section is about the work I have done previously, the languages I used and what the work was all about. It also includes some of the languages I used.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* This is a great place
* to list setup instructions
* in a simple
* easy-to-understand
* format
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Known Bugs
My website is not fully responsive, working towards correcting that using bootstrap.
## Technologies Used
I used HTML AND CSS to create this portfolio. HTML for the structure and css for the styling. I used vscode as my code editor and deployed on Github.
